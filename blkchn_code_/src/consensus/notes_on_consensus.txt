What should be soon done :
- Try to put the dictionnary in leveldb
- Do the verification (using CUDA could be pretty nice)
- Must add a PRNG to find a k random to hash the final hash of the block (in consensus_evaluation) in order to detect the next validator

Note :
- The python script is only here to check if the n times hash worked in the evaluation part
